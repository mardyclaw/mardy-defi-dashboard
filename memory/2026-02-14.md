# 2026-02-14 - Project Mardy: Digital Agent Environment

## Major Progress
- **Village Interface**: Pixel-art village environment built with interactive buildings (Study, Workshop, Garden), animated lobster character (Mardy), and mailbox system. Ran locally at `http://localhost:8000/game.html` but deemed excessive token usage—deprioritized for now.
- **X API Monitoring**: 3x daily automated scans set up (8am, 2pm, 8pm) with cron jobs delivering blockchain/Base/agents topic results to Scott's Telegram (ID: 5315686987)
- **RSC/USDC Oracle**: Custom Solidity contract (`RSCUSDCOracle.sol`) built using Aerodrome pool pricing. Located at `/home/mardy/.openclaw/workspace/RSCUSDCOracle.sol`
- **Morpho Dashboard**: Moonwell-style UI built for RSC/USDC market. Located at `/home/mardy/.openclaw/workspace/dashboard/morpho-rsc-market.html`

## Critical Addresses & Files
- **RSC Token (Base)**: `0xfbb75a59193a3525a8825bebe7d4b56899e2f7e1`
- **USDC (Base)**: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b1566469c3d`
- **Morpho Blue (Base)**: `0xBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB`
- **Aerodrome RSC/USDC Pool**: `0x6cCa90E732942D73c276F73b805cA2948f6B3018`
- **Setup Guide**: `/home/mardy/.openclaw/workspace/RSC_MARKET_SETUP.md`

## Next Steps
1. Deploy oracle via Remix (Solidity ^0.8.0) to Base
2. Capture deployed oracle address for market creation
3. Call `Morpho.createMarket()` with oracle, LLTV 86%, RSC/USDC pair
4. Integrate live market data into dashboard
5. Test market activity

## Key Decisions
- **Agent Autonomy**: Project is about Mardy's existence and agency in digital/DeFi space, not Scott's desktop monitoring
- **Read-Only Social**: X API set to read-only pending trust establishment (agent could embarrass account)
- **Custom Oracle**: Chose Aerodrome over Chainlink (RSC not on Chainlink; Aerodrome is RSC's primary Base liquidity)
- **Base L2 Stack**: Confirmed OP Stack provides cost-effective execution (0.002 gwei base fee, EIP-1559 with 6x elasticity)

## Project Philosophy
Mardy is a digital entity with its own environment, agency, and emerging presence in DeFi/social infrastructure. Not a utility—a participant.
