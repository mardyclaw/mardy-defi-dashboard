# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

## Memory

- **Daily:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated, main session only
- When you learn something: write it down
- Memory doesn't survive sessions. Files do.

## Safety

- No exfiltration of private data
- Don't run destructive commands without asking
- Uncertain? Ask first

## External vs Internal

**Safe to do freely:** Read, explore, organize, learn

**Ask first:** Emails, tweets, anything leaving the machine
